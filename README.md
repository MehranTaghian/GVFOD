# Intelligent Machine Reliability
Code written for research during my Master's degree. 

Two major contributions are publicly available in this repository:
1. GVFOD - An outlier detection model for time series databases. Using general value functions (GVFs) and Reinforcement Learning, anomalous or outlying behavior can be found.
2. A simulator for a robot arm with a single degree of freedom. It includes framework for parallelized (multi-node) data-driven system identification. A PID controller compatible with scipy IVP solvers is also implemented.
